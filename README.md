# Hey there! 

![](https://hitx.vercel.app/counter/?id=https://github.com/MrCoolAndroid/MrCoolAndroid&t=GitHub%20views)

## Who I am?
- I am a young developer from Argentina, I started this journey in 2017!  
- I am a main C# developer, but im still open to new languages!  
- New to GitHub, so i am still learning how to use it well  

## What i am developing
- I have many private projects but my main one is [this one!](https://github.com/MrCoolAndroid/Xbox-Rich-Presence-Discord)  

I dont create a lot of things just because sometimes i am out of ideas, my computer is not powerful enough or simply i dont know how to do it  
but i still create sample apps just to learn more!

## Social media
- I mainly use Discord (MrCoolAndroid#2118) so if you want to talk or anything contact me!

## What are my goals?
- [X] Create my first application
- [X] Make you read this (hehe)
- [ ] Create my first game (maybe, why not)

## The end for now
Thanks for reading this! I havent write much but anyways
